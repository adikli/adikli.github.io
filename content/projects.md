Our lab work on mites that are agricultural pests and focuses on several aspect research, primarily related to mite-plant interactions.
We use molecular tools such as DNA and RNA isolation and sequencing, confocal microscopy using immunostaining and FISH methods as well as, in the near future, proteomic tools to investigate the various questions we still have about mites from different families.
Our current main research topics are: 

### 1.	Insecticide resistance aspects in Tetranychus urticae.
T. urticae or the Two-Spotted Spider Mite (TSSM) is the most economically devastating herbivore mite pest worldwide. It is able to feed on hundreds of different plant crop species. Though having a very small genome, it has highly expanded metabolic gene families which enable it to digest a variety of xenobiotics: be it plant secondary metabolites or acaricides.
Its short generation time and reproductive characteristics add to its ability to develop acaricide resistance at a remarkable rate. 
In our lab, we study several aspects of those abilities:
-	We plan to perform surveys from all over Israel, with the help of the Israeli ministry of agriculture's [extension services](https://www.gov.il/en/departments/units/shaham-unit) , collecting TSSM samples where and whenever an outburst is reported. Those will be tested for resistance to all classes of approved acaricides (in Israel) with known MOAs.
-	Life history tables, reproductive behaviour and fitness of all susceptible and resistant field-collected populations will be studied.
-	Known markers to different acaricides will be tested and adjusted to allow for the development of a rapid, genetic-based test for resistance in field populations.
 
### 2.	Eriophyte mites in aubergine farming in Israel.
A new symptom caused by eriophyte mites was reported in 2017 in aubergine fields. Since then, it has spread throughout Israel and is causing increasing damage. The species of these mites is yet undetermined. 
In our lab, we wish to use genetic systematic tools to determine if this is a new identified species. In parallel, we are conducting field experiments aimed to create a better IPM program for aubergine in Israel, both in the field and in net-houses for dealing with these mites as well as other pests. 
The extent of the damage and symptoms created by these mites will also be determined. 

Past and prospective research ventures:

### 3.	Identifying secondary metabolites in Cannabis that may act as repellents/attractants for Tetranychus urticae.
### 4.	Molecular taxonomy and genetic markers search in various mite families.
Greatly due to their minute size, mites have been grossly over looked and very little is known about their biology and diversity in comparison to other organisms.
Another aspect in which this lack of data is felt is the taxonomy of mites. Nowadays, mite taxonomy relays almost entirely on exterior morphology.
Mite classification is therefore a lengthy process, requiring a large sample size, expensive and specialized microscopic equipment and above all- expertise. 
The expert knowledge is shown insufficient nowadays as several studies, using DNA barcoding methods showed that morphological indistinguishable samples can actually be completely different species. 
The problem is further extended in families such as the Acaridae soil mites, where sufficient barcoding has yet been identified.

The first goal of this project is to expand the data available on various mites by sequencing the complete Mito-genome of as many species as possible.

Our second goal is to make identification even quicker and easier, by developing size-based markers for morphologically indistinguishable species in different mite families. 
We do so by isolating Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs), also known as microsatellites, from sequencing data available and using that to design primers.
Those primers are tested on pools and individuals from each species.
Upon completion of this project, we plan to have markers for fast and easy identification of different species of spider mites, false spider mites as well as different Acaridae species.

### 5.	Broad mite effectors secreted to plant hosts affecting plant development.
The broad mite, Polyphagotarsonemus latus, is a serious pest in tropical and subtropical areas in the world. P. latus is a polyphagous mite that can feed on various species from both mono and di-cotyledonal plants. It is considered an extremely dangerous pest on annual crop plants. This is due to the deformation damage caused to the plant hosts; broad mite feeding can cause leaf deformation, dwarfing, flower lost and fruit- deformation. If not treated on time, the damage from the mites' feeding can last long after the mites have been dealt with.
Our hypothesis is therefore that broad mite secrets molecules, also known as 'effectors', during feeding into its plant host. We further hypothesize that those effectors are the ones causing the deformation seen in the plant, long after the mites have been killed. 
 
The goal of this project is to identify these effectors, egested by broad mite to plant during feeding. 
After identifying these effectors, we wish to identify their targets in the plants and study the effect on plant development and growth. 

### 6.	Circadian rhythms in plant feeding mites.
Circadian rhythms allow organisms to behave in accordance with the daily and seasonal conditions in which they are living. These circadian rhythms change based on environmental cues, such as photoperiod and temperature, to adapt to the constantly changing environment. 
Circadian rhythms were studied in the "model mite" the Two Spotted Spider Mite (TSSM), Tetranychus urticae, We wish to study further aspects in TSSM and uncover the genetic mechanisms governing these, using  RNA sequencing methods and cutting edge mathematical modelling of gene expression patterns. 
This research will be conducted in collaboration with [Dr. Rea Antoniou-Kourounioti](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/cop26/az/reaantoniou-kourounioti/) from Glasgow University.
