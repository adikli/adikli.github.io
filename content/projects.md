Our lab work on mites that are agricultural pests and focuses on several aspect research, primarily related to mite-plant interactions.
We use molecular tools such as DNA and RNA isolation and sequencing, confocal microscopy using immunostaining and FISH methods as well as, in the near future, proteomic tools to investigate the various questions we still have about mites from different families.
Our current main research topics are: 

### 1. Molecular taxonomy and genetic markers search in various mite families.

Greatly due to their minute size, mites have been grossly over looked and very little is known about their biology and diversity in comparison to other organisms.
Another aspect in which this lack of data is felt is the taxonomy of mites. Nowadays, mite taxonomy relays almost entirely on exterior morphology.
Mite classification is therefore a lengthy process, requiring a large sample size, expensive and specialized microscopic equipment and above all- expertise. 
The expert knowledge is shown insufficient nowadays as several studies, using DNA barcoding methods showed that morphological indistinguishable samples can actually be completely different species. 
The problem is further extended in families such as the Acaridae soil mites, where sufficient barcoding has yet been identified.

The first goal of this project is to expand the data available on various mites by sequencing the complete Mito-genome of as many species as possible.

Our second goal is to make identification even quicker and easier, by developing size-based markers for morphologically indistinguishable species in different mite families. 
We do so by isolating Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs), also known as microsatellites, from sequencing data available and using that to design primers.
Those primers are tested on pools and individuals from each species.
Upon completion of this project, we plan to have markers for fast and easy identification of different species of spider mites, false spider mites as well as different Acaridae species.

### 2. Broad mite effectors secreted to plant hosts affecting plant development.

The broad mite, Polyphagotarsonemus latus, is a serious pest in tropical and subtropical areas in the world. P. latus is a polyphagous mite that can feed on various species from both mono and di-cotyledonal plants. It is considered an extremely dangerous pest on annual crop plants. This is due to the deformation damage caused to the plant hosts; broad mite feeding can cause leaf deformation, dwarfing, flower lost and fruit- deformation. If not treated on time, the damage from the mites' feeding can last long after the mites have been dealt with.
Our hypothesis is therefore that broad mite secrets molecules, also known as 'effectors', during feeding into its plant host. We further hypothesize that those effectors are the ones causing the deformation seen in the plant, long after the mites have been killed. 
 
The goal of this project is to identify these effectors, egested by broad mite to plant during feeding. 
After identifying these effectors, we wish to identify their targets in the plants and study the effect on plant development and growth. 

### 3. Circadian rhythms in plant feeding mites.

Circadian rhythms allow organisms to behave in accordance with the daily and seasonal conditions in which they are living. These circadian rhythms change based on environmental cues, such as photoperiod and temperature, to adapt to the constantly changing environment. 
Circadian rhythms were studied in the "model mite" the Two Spotted Spider Mite (TSSM), Tetranychus urticae, We wish to study further aspects in TSSM and uncover the genetic mechanisms governing these, using cutting edge RNA sequencing methods. 
Furthermore, we wish to study circadian behaviours in other pest mite species in the hopes of using the data one day to develop novel and environmentally friendly means of managing those in the field.
