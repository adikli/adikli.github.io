- [Prof. Inon Scharf, TAU](http://inonscharflab.weebly.com/)

Inon studies behaviours of various arthropods. Together we are trying to learn more about the daily rhythms of the two-spotted spider mite. 
- [Prof. Vered Tzin, BGU](https://veredtzin.wixsite.com/vtzinlab)

Vered studies secondary metabolites produced by plants in response to herbivore attacks. Together we are trying to learn more about plants' reactions to the two- spotted spider mite.
- [Dr. Yogev Burko, ARO](https://63b2df5af1cca.site123.me/)

Yogev studies plants' reactions to abiotic and biotic stressors. Together we are examining the effect shading and temperature has on the reaction of tomatoes to the two-spotted spider mite.
- [Dr. Rea Antoniou-Kourounioti, GU](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/molecularbiosciences/staff/realailaantonioukourounioti/#researchinterests)

Rea uses mathematical models to simulate and predict proteins' expression in plants in response to different temperatures. Together we want to develop models that will predict mites' performance on plants under warm temperatures. 
- [Prof. Peter DiGennaro, University of Wisconsin- Madison](https://plantpath.wisc.edu/faculty/peter-digennaro/)

Peter studies plant-nematode interactions and the effect of warm temperatures on these interactions. Together, we want to locate common plant QTLs that respond to both nematode and mite attack under warm climate.
- [Assoc. Prof. Sean Schoville, University of Wisconsin- Madison](https://molecularecology.russell.wisc.edu/)

Sean studies the evolution of polygenic traits, local adaptation and gene flow across geographical areas. Together we wish to study the evolution of multi-pesticide resistance traits in the two-spotted spider mite.
