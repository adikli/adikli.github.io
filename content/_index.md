Welcome to our group!

Our lab works on mites that are agricultural pests and focuses on several research aspects, primarily related to mite-plant interactions.

We use molecular tools such as DNA and RNA isolation and sequencing, confocal microscopy using immunostaining and FISH methods. In the near future, we will also integrate proteomic tools to investigate the various questions we still have about mites from different families.

As we are located at the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture's ARO (Agriculture Research Organization), our research priorities combine both basic and applicable science as well as field research; dealing with issues reported by growers in Israel.
